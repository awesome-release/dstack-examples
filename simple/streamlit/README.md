# A simple service (Streamlit)

This is one of the simplest examples that demonstrates how to use services.

This service runs `streamlit hello`.

To deploy this service, execute the following command from the root directory of the repo:

```shell
dstack run . -f simple/streamlit/serve.dstack.yml
```
